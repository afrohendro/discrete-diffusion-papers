## Introduction

Discrete diffusion models are essential for understanding how particles spread in a given space over time. These models have applications in fields such as physics, biology, and finance. This repository aims to compile significant research papers that explore various aspects of discrete diffusion.

## What are Discrete Diffusion Models?

Discrete diffusion models describe how substances move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. Unlike continuous models, discrete models represent the diffusion process in distinct steps or intervals. This approach allows for a more granular analysis of diffusion phenomena.

### Key Characteristics

- **Stepwise Movement**: Particles move in discrete steps rather than continuously.
- **Localized Interaction**: Interactions occur between nearby particles, making the model suitable for simulations.
- **Flexibility**: Can be adapted to various scenarios, including irregular geometries and varying diffusion rates.
